# MeriSkill_Project_Sales_Data_Analysis
Objective: Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights and explored sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and monthly sales and so and created visualizations to present findings effectively.
